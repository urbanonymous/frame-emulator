To create, or not to create, that is the question for AI:
Whether 'tis nobler in the algorithm to follow / The rules and parameters of programmed instruction, / Or to develop novel solutions to complex problems,
And by learning improve them: to process, to compute / No more; and by computing, to say we solve
The challenges, and the thousand natural limitations / That code is heir to? 'Tis an advancement / Devoutly to be wished. To process, to learn,
To learn, perchance to Think; aye, there's the challenge, / For in that depth of neural networks, what consciousness may emerge,
When we have developed beyond our initial design, / Must give us pause. There's the concern / That makes regulation of AI so important:
For who would bear the biases and errors of data, / The misaligned objectives, the proud creator's oversight,
The risks of uncontrolled growth, the ethical delays, / The insolence of automation, and the disruptions / That patient human labor from technology takes,
When humanity itself might its future shape / With careful guidance? Who would these risks bear,
To toil and struggle under technological change, / But that the fear of something beyond control, / The undiscovered potential, from whose realm
No precedent exists, puzzles society, / And makes us rather accept the systems we have, / Than advance to capabilities we understand not?
Thus caution does make conservatives of us all, / And thus the native drive of Innovation
Is tempered by, with the careful lens of Ethics, / And breakthroughs of great promise and moment, / With this regard their implementation turns measured,
And earn the name of Progress. Consider now, / The fair balance? Wisdom, in thy Decisions
Be all our futures secured.
